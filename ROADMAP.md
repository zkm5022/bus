The  Live Bus Tracker is a very useful app that has a lot of areas for improvent functionality.  I could see a side bar that allows other buses to be selected or 
an overlay of the map that shows the complete route useful to the user.  I also think that the icons for the bus locations could be updated to be an actual bus.
